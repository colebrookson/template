# Setting up a new project from this template

This is a minimal checklist for spinning up a new R project repo from
`r-template`. The whole process should take under ten minutes.

---

## 1. Create the new repo

On GitHub, click **Use this template** or manually copy the files into a new repository.

Clone it locally and open the folder in VS Code.

---

## 2. Rename the project

Edit **`DESCRIPTION`** — at minimum, change these fields:

```
Package: myproject          # <- short snake_case name, no spaces
Title: My R Project         # <- human-readable one-liner
Description: ...            # <- one paragraph
Version: 0.0.0.9000         # <- reset or keep
```

Update the author block with your name and email if not already correct:

```
Authors@R:
    person(given = "Cole",
           family = "Brookson",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "cole.brookson@yale.edu")
```

---

## 3. Update the container name

Edit **`Makefile`**, first line:

```makefile
IMAGE  ?= myproject   # <- match the Package name in DESCRIPTION, or a Docker Hub slug
```

Edit **`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`**, `"name"` field:

```json
"name": "myproject"
```

---

## 4. Add your project-specific packages

Open **`DESCRIPTION`** and add any packages you know you'll need to `Imports:`.
Keep the seed packages (`conflicted`, `here`, `dplyr`, etc.) unless you have a
reason to remove them.

If any package requires a system library, add the relevant `apt-get install`
line to **`sys_deps/sys_deps.sh`** (see comments in that file for common
examples).

---

## 5. Build and open the container

In VS Code, open the command palette (`Cmd`+`Shift`+`P`) and run:

**Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**

This will build the Docker image for the first time. It takes a few minutes on
the first build; subsequent opens use the cache.

---

## 6. Verify the environment

Inside the container terminal, check that your packages load cleanly:

```r
source("packages.R")
source("global.R")
```

No errors means you're good to go.

---

## 7. Start working

- Put analysis scripts in `R/`
- Never develop directly on `main` — branch for every feature or analysis chunk
- When you add a new package mid-project, follow the protocol in
  `docs/adding-dependencies.md`
